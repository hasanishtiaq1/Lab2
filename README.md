The Task was to create an interpretor using Java or c++. I have implemented this code using Java. There mainly four functions of the program. readFile() , Tokennize() , isInteger() and calculation(). As it is obvious from their names. The first function read commands from file. Second function tokenize it and store it into data structures. Third one checks if given string is integer or not and Last one calculate the output. 
There is one unit test for this program.
